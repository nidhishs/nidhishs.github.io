### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nidhish, Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher. You've found the source code for my website and blog; feel free to look around. I write about AI research and building split mechanical keyboards - two very different things that somehow both involve a lot of tinkering.
Expect some thoughts on neural nets, split keyboards, and maybe a few other nerdy obsessions I pick up along the way. You'll also find my published papers, preprints, and technical reports. Each explores different aspects of ML research - from language models, computer vision to medical AI.
